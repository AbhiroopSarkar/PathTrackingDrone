# PathTrackingDrone
The Real-Time Drone Path Tracking project applies the principles of a line-following robot to aerial navigation. Using Computer Vision, the drone is able to track a designated path or line from above, similar to how ground-based robots follow lines on a surface. The system processes video feed through the cv2 (OpenCV) module, detecting a predefined path (such as a colored line or contrast-based markers) in real-time. The drone adjusts its flight based on the detected line's position, ensuring continuous tracking. This concept mirrors a line-following robot, which uses sensors to detect and follow lines on the ground. In the drone's case, Computer Vision serves as its "eye," while programmed flight corrections mimic the motor control in a ground-based robot. This innovative project allows drones to autonomously follow paths, opening up possibilities in automated deliveries, inspection, or exploration tasks.
